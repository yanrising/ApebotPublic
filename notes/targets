Buying more on a dex a few minutes after it launched on binance only if the price on binance is higher, to then sell at a higher price on binance. Trade on dex executed 2 minutes after binance launch time.
Price on uniswap was 16 and was 18 on binance. 
Token pair is FXS/BUSD @ launch.

Unsolved dilemma: Why did our friend purchase FXS on February 12? 
Interstingly he plunked down 10k USDT 
his pattern is to buy small caps, like $SPDR at 10k increments.
Just his own manual trading, doesn't seem automated.
